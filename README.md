## about the UI UX
the first draft version was simple and quick ready to go ,the player entre a user name and just generate a link ,he share it with a friend via social media
,the friend enter the link, assuming that one player is waiting the game is ready to go.
after sharing this game with friends and some players who used to play chess in platforms like (chess.com and lichess.org), i recieved some good feedbacks about the 
quick setup of a game (no authentication needed) , but after seeing my Logs actually no one return after the first time ,and that lack of engagement is justified.
because i think that chess players want always to explore new opponents that's how i needed to think about a new way to matching players and connecting them ,so i did core changes as i introduced : authentication and user connections ( friend) process .to quickly have an overview the about current UI UX let's see the following illustration:
