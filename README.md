- the new user have at first authenticate,the UI shows multiple choice (email/password,continue with google or continue with facebook oauth provider), after authenticate successfully ,
- a new UI appear shows an avatar photo (provider photo or a default one) the user have to enter a user name to continue. the account is created and the user get redirected to the home page .
- in ordre to setup a game , the home page will suggest you last connected users to invite and  you can also invite a fiends from outside ,the friend has to connect first,one part share his tag id so the other can find and invite him, we have an issue if the player don't respond quickly so we add a section of Historical game so the player may have interest and not get bothered by waiting for couple of minute.noting that the game request expire after a certain time , for now it's setted up at "10 min" - as soon as the opponent accept the invitation both players get redirected to the Game and that's it. the users are supposed to connect with each others in ordre to re - match and find previous opponent .
